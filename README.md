We are going to change paces somewhat for this weekend's assignment.

Fork [this](https://github.com/NOVA-Uncommon-Coders/ScratchPad).

Go to [this page](http://codingbat.com/java). Pick 10 practice problems.

Create a ScratchPad-style project and complete each practice problem.

Above each problem copy and paste the description of the problem and comment it out.

Write Tests using Junit that prove the tests work.

# HARD MODE
Tackle some of the medium and hard-level questions. Complete 15 Total

Use Gradle or Maven to include JUnit into your scratchpad.

# LUDICROUSMODE
Instead of using codingbat, solve 4 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems.
